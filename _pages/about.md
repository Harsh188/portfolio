I'm an aspring Machine Learning (ML) Engineer who is enthusiastic to build the next generation tools required to bridge the gap between research and the implementation. Specifically, I'm interested in developing end-to-end pipelines to effectively utilize the state-of-the-art ML models to satisfy customer requirements.

The areas which I'm currently researching are graph neural networks, semi-supervision, data analytics, and computer vision. I enjoy implementing research ideas and communicating my experience through [articles](https://medium.com/@harsh188) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFpda-r5V_aHpBVgYhm_JDA).

I'm a 4th year student at PES University studying Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Machine Intelligence and Data Science. I've had a long history of community contributions ranging from my research publications, Google Summer of Code, and various clubs.
