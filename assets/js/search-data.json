Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm . 1.13.0+cu117 . Introduction to Tensors . A Tensor is an algebraic object that describes multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. . Creating Tensors . A torch.Tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type. There are various data types which can be defined. There are also CPU and GPU tensors. . Scalar . scalar = torch.tensor(7) scalar . tensor(7) . scalar.ndim . 0 . scalar.item() . 7 . Vectors . vector = torch.tensor([1,2]) vector . tensor([1, 2]) . vector.ndim . 1 . vector.shape . torch.Size([2]) . Matrix . matrix = torch.tensor([[1,2], [3,4]]) matrix . tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) . matrix.ndim . 2 . matrix.shape . torch.Size([2, 2]) . Tensors . tensor = torch.tensor([[[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]]) tensor . tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]) . tensor.ndim . 3 . tensor.shape . torch.Size([1, 3, 3]) . The following image visually depicts the difference between scalars, vectors, matrix and tensors. . Random Tensors . A machine learning model often starts out with large random tensors and adjusts these random numbers as it works through the data to represent it in a better way. To do this in PyTorch we can use the torch.rand method. . random_tensor = torch.rand(size=(3,4)) random_tensor, random_tensor.dtype . (tensor([[0.3864, 0.4220, 0.3463, 0.1763], [0.3355, 0.9340, 0.2307, 0.6128], [0.0757, 0.9835, 0.4912, 0.1533]]), torch.float32) . random_image_size_tensor = torch.rand(size=(224,224,3)) random_image_size_tensor.shape, random_image_size_tensor.ndim . (torch.Size([224, 224, 3]), 3) . Zeros and Ones . Sometimes we just want to fill tensors with zeros or ones. We can do this using the torch.zeros() or torch.ones() method. . zeros_tensor = torch.zeros(size=(3,4)) zeros_tensor, zeros_tensor.dtype . (tensor([[0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 0.]]), torch.float32) . ones_tensor = torch.ones(size=(3,4)) ones_tensor, ones_tensor.dtype . (tensor([[1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.]]), torch.float32) . Creating a range and tensors like . To create a range of numbers we can use torch.arange(start, end, step). . zero_to_ten = torch.arange(start=0,end=10,step=1) zero_to_ten . tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) . To mimic a shape of another tensor we can use torch.rand_like(input), torch.zeros_like(input) or torch.ones_like(input). . rand_zeros_tensor_like = torch.rand_like(zeros_tensor) rand_zeros_tensor_like, rand_zeros_tensor_like.dtype . (tensor([[0.6870, 0.7167, 0.6738, 0.9651], [0.1833, 0.4796, 0.7711, 0.6932], [0.2788, 0.0643, 0.0418, 0.5420]]), torch.float32) . Getting Information from Tensors . The most common attributes of tensors are shape, dtype and device. . some_tensor = torch.rand(size=(3,4)) # Display details of tensor print(some_tensor) print(f&quot;Shape of tensor: {some_tensor.shape}&quot;) print(f&quot;Datatype of tensor: {some_tensor.dtype}&quot;) print(f&quot;Device tensor is stored on: {some_tensor.device}&quot;) . tensor([[0.0452, 0.0207, 0.7986, 0.6861], [0.4294, 0.7774, 0.5604, 0.4319], [0.1340, 0.9240, 0.3545, 0.6204]]) Shape of tensor: torch.Size([3, 4]) Datatype of tensor: torch.float32 Device tensor is stored on: cpu . Manipulating Tensors (operations) . One of the most important tensor operations in deep learning is matrix multiplication. . tensor = torch.tensor([1,2,3]) tensor.shape . torch.Size([3]) . tensor * tensor . tensor([1, 4, 9]) . torch.matmul(tensor, tensor) . tensor(14) . Indexing . How do we access specific data from tensors? . some_tensor = torch.arange(start=1, end=10).reshape(1, 3, 3) some_tensor, some_tensor.shape . (tensor([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]), torch.Size([1, 3, 3])) . print(f&quot;First square bracket: {some_tensor[0]}&quot;) print(f&quot;Second square bracket: {some_tensor[0][0]}&quot;) print(f&quot;Third square bracket: {some_tensor[0][0][0]}&quot;) . First square bracket: tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) Second square bracket: tensor([1, 2, 3]) Third square bracket: 1 . print(f&quot;First row of tensor: {some_tensor[:,0]}&quot;) . First row of tensor: tensor([[1, 2, 3]]) . print(f&quot;Second column of tensor: {some_tensor[:,:,1]}&quot;) . Second column of tensor: tensor([[2, 5, 8]]) . print(f&quot;Selecting bottom right 2x2 grid: {some_tensor[:,1:,1:]}&quot;) . Selecting bottom right 2x2 grid: tensor([[[5, 6], [8, 9]]]) . PyTorch and NumPy . PyTorch has built in functionality to convert NumPy arrays into PyTorch tensors. This is done using the torch.from_numpy(ndarray) method. To convert a Tensor to an array we can use torch.Tensor.numpy(). . array = np.random.rand(3,3) array, torch.from_numpy(array) . (array([[0.52877635, 0.51487637, 0.28748219], [0.03840897, 0.40011216, 0.7600652 ], [0.65834844, 0.06947759, 0.87114052]]), tensor([[0.5288, 0.5149, 0.2875], [0.0384, 0.4001, 0.7601], [0.6583, 0.0695, 0.8711]], dtype=torch.float64)) . some_tensor = torch.rand(size=(3,3)) some_tensor, some_tensor.numpy() . (tensor([[0.1617, 0.9384, 0.5670], [0.3329, 0.2371, 0.1353], [0.7492, 0.9597, 0.1461]]), array([[0.1617378 , 0.9383805 , 0.5670012 ], [0.3328787 , 0.23712236, 0.13531995], [0.7492051 , 0.9597247 , 0.14605427]], dtype=float32)) . PyTorch on GPU . torch.cuda.is_available() . True . device = &quot;cuda&quot; if torch.cuda.is_available() else &quot;cpu&quot; device . &#39;cuda&#39; . torch.cuda.device_count() . 1 . PyTorch maintains a seperation of where tensors are stored. If we are using GPUs for training then we have to put the tensors on the gpu device. This allows us to run faster numerical computation than using a CPU. . some_tensor = torch.ones(size=(3,3)) # Move the tensor to GPU tensor_on_gpu = tensor.to(device) # Check where the tensor exists print(tensor, tensor.device) # Check where the tensor exists print(tensor_on_gpu, tensor_on_gpu.device) . tensor([1, 2, 3]) cpu tensor([1, 2, 3], device=&#39;cuda:0&#39;) cuda:0 . To move the tensor back to CPU we can use torch.to(&#39;cpu&#39;). This is needed if we want to convert our tensor into a numpy array. . Exercises . Create a random tensor with shape (7, 7). | torch.rand(size=(7,7)) . tensor([[0.2939, 0.0436, 0.6219, 0.6090, 0.0334, 0.9435, 0.1173], [0.0818, 0.6880, 0.7191, 0.8980, 0.3537, 0.1512, 0.4098], [0.9492, 0.9181, 0.6112, 0.0101, 0.9554, 0.4541, 0.3899], [0.2519, 0.8227, 0.8853, 0.8640, 0.9598, 0.2262, 0.0393], [0.4030, 0.5945, 0.6027, 0.6424, 0.8491, 0.8344, 0.0452], [0.2884, 0.2951, 0.8422, 0.9204, 0.8882, 0.1274, 0.8725], [0.1320, 0.8361, 0.7701, 0.8724, 0.7167, 0.5192, 0.1237]]) . Perform a matrix multiplication on the tensor from the previous problem with another random tensor with shape (1, 7) (hint: you may have to transpose the second tensor). | tensor_1 = torch.rand(size=(7,7)) tensor_2 = torch.rand(size=(1,7)) print(tensor_1.shape, tensor_2.shape) torch.matmul(tensor_1, tensor_2.T) . torch.Size([7, 7]) torch.Size([1, 7]) . tensor([[2.2379], [2.9939], [3.8932], [3.3609], [2.9280], [2.7368], [1.4672]]) .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
